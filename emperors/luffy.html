              Luffy has shaggy hair, round black eyes and a slim muscular build. He is famously known for his trademark Straw Hat, hence the name Straw Hat Luffy. Originally the straw hat was Gol D Roger's, but he gave it to shanks who then handed it down to Luffy. Luffy wears blue shorts, sandals, and a sleeveless red vest. He also has a scar with two stitches underneath his eye because he stabbed himself with a knife to prove to shanks he is strong and fearless. Luffy received a large x-shaped scar on his chest after battling with Akainu at the Summit War of Marineford.
