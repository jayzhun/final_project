            <p>
              Shanks, also known as "Red Hair" Shanks is the Captain of the Red
              Hair Pirates. Also one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New
              World. As a kid, he sailed with the Roger pirates along with Buggy
              before he created his own crew after Gol D Roger's death. While he
              was in the East Blue, he met Luffy and inspired him to become a
              pirate. He sacrificed his left arm to save Luffy from a sea
              monster and gave him his signature straw hat as a farewell gift.
              He told Luffy to promise to bring it back once he becomes
              stronger.

              Shanks is a tall, muscular man with tan skin. He has distinctly
              red hair with a middle part and bangs. Shanks possesses a
              trademark triple set line of scars that pass vertically, over his
              left eye. It's revealed that Blackbeard has given him the scars.
              He wears a black coat, white button up, pants and slippers. He is
              known for his swordmanship and haki(a mysterious power that allows
              the user to utilize their own energy for a variety of purposes).
              It is rumored that Shanks has the strongest conquerors haki in the
              verse, allowing him to knockout strong enemies in an instant.
