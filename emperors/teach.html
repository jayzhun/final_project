            <h1>Blackbeard</h1>
            <p>
              Marshall D.Teach, also known as Blackbeard is the captain of the
              Blackbeard Pirates and one of the four emperors. Only person in
              history to wield the power of two devil fruits. He begun his
              pirate career as an apprentice of the Whitebeard pirates but
              sabotaged the crew by murdering fellow crewmate Thatch in order to
              steal the Yami Yami no mi which allows the user to create a
              blackhole at will. At the Summit War of Marineford, he killed his
              old captain Whitebeard in order to obtain his Gura Gura no mi
              power, which causes an individual to create earthquakes so intense
              it can cause a tsunami in minutes. Post war he conquered a
              majority of Whitebeard's territories and became known as one of
              the four emperors. His crew consist of violent impel down
              criminals who all have a devil fruit.

            <p>
              Blackbeard is an extremely large individual with large skin. He
              has a massive build with a round but but relatively thin limbs. He
              is missing several teeth and has a very hairy chest. He has a
              signature scruffy blackbeard that he grows around his jawline.
              Blackbeard wears golden hoop earrings with a bandana. He wears a
              black captains coat with red linings and dark blue pants with
              floral designs.
