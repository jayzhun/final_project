              Buggy is the captain of the Buggy Pirates. He was a former apprentice of the Roger Pirates alongside Shanks. After the Summit War of Marineford, he became a member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Soon the warlord system was abolished so his title was stripped. Following the downfall of Kaidou and Big Mom, he was announced as one of the Four Emperors due to him creating the Cross Guild which consist of the worlds strongest swordsman, Dracula Mihawk. Buggy ate the devil fruit, Bara Bara no Mi, also known as the chop chop fruit.
