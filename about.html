        <h1>About the Strawhats</h1>
          <p>
            The Strawhat Pirates consist of ten crewmates. The captain is Monkey
            D Luffy. A charasmatic, goofy yet strong character who dreams of one
            day finding the One Piece and obtaining the title of the Pirate
            King.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Vice Captain of the ship is Zoro. He uses a three sword style
            technique and has excellent haki to slice through the toughest of
            foes. He dreams of being the World's Strongest Swordsman in honor of
            his deceased childhood friend
          </p>
        <p>
          The navigator of the ship is nami. They call her the cat burgler
          because of her sneaky ways of stealing treasure from the enemies. She
          is not a fighter unlike luffy and zoro. But she does wield a staff
          created in a sky island which is able to use lightning powers to
          defend against foes. She dreams mapping out the entire world
        </p>
        <p>
          The cook of the ship is Sanji. Son of Germa 66 Judge, he ran away from
          home at a young age due to his abusive relationship with his family.
          His battle techniques consist of kicking but no hands as he believes
          that hands should only be used to cook and not fight. Sanji is seen as
          a big pervert in the story as he falls in love with every women he
          meets. His dream is to find the All Blue
        </p>
        <p>
          Usopp is the sniper of the crew. He doesn't use an actual gun but
          instead a slingshot with special pellets that has different effects.
          He is known as a coward in fights and gets frightened easily. His
          dream is to become the bravest warrior of the sea. Quite fitting isn't
          it?
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctor of the crew is Chopper. A reindeer that ate the hito hito
          no mi which allows him to turn into a human reindeer. Similar to
          luffy, he is able to take on different transformations for different
          fighting scenarios. His dream is to find a cure for all diseases
        </p>
        <p>
          Robin is the archeologist of the crew. As a child, she and the people
          of Oharu studied and taught themselves how to read poneglyphs. This
          ability is crucial as the poneglyphs are messages left behind that
          lead to the One Piece. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which
          tells the true history of the world, the Void Century.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shipwright of the crew is franky. He is a cyborg who used
          Dr.Vegapunks blueprints to reconfigure his body. He now how cool
          functions that include switching hairstyles by pushing his nose. His
          dream is to build a ship that can circumnavigate the world
        </p>
        <p>
          The musician of the crew is Brooke. A tall skeleton with an afro and
          obssession with panties. He ate the Revive-Revive Fruit which allowed
          him to return to life after death once. He eventually learned to tap
          deeper into the powers of his fruit and gain control over his souls
          and the souls of others. Brooke is a Swordsman along with zoro. His
          dream is to meet up with Laboon, a whale he befriended long ago
        </p>
        <p>
          The last crewmember is Jinbei, the helmsman of the ship. He is a
          whaleshark fishman and uses fishman karate technique to defeat his
          foes. Was once a warlord of the sea, he joined Luffy's crew after
          Luffy saved fish man island. His dream is to find equality between
          fishmen/mermen and humans.
