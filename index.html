        <h2>"THE ONE PIECE IS REAL"</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>One Piece</strong> is the legendary treasure needed to
          become the King of the Pirates. Embark on a journey and learn the
          story of a young man named Monkey D. Luffy. His dream is to become
          King of the Pirates. Alongside a crew of his most trusted friends,
          Luffy sails the dangerous seas of the Grand Line to find the island
          Laugh Tale, which is said to contain the infamous One Piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          It all started when Luffy was a young child, on an island in the East
          Blue Sea he met a pirate who is known as Shanks. At first Luffy hated
          pirates, but as time went on and their friendship has grown stronger,
          he started to admire Shanks and want to be a pirate like him when he
          grows up. One day as they were having friendly banter in a nearby bar,
          Luffy accidentally ate a devil fruit Shanks stole, called the Guma
          Guma no Mi, which causes you're body to have rubber components and
          stretch. Shanks and his fruit have stolen this fruit from the World
          Government and were in shock when they saw Luffy arm stretch across
          the room. Shortly after that incident, Shanks and his crew were about
          to sail off to sea to continue their adventures. He sees Luffy one
          last time to say his goodbyes and gives him his precious strawhat as a
          farewell gift. From then on Luffy pledges to get a crew stronger than
          shanks and become King of the Pirates. Thus, begins the story of
          Monkey D Luffy and his crew, The Strawhat Pirates.
